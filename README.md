Brownian Motion of Anisotropic Particles In Two Dimensions

We modeled the Brownian motion of an ellipsoidal particle in two dimensions. We simulated
its behavior by using square lattice for position (x,y) and concidering orientation of particle.
We are looking for crossover from short-time anisotropic to the long-time isotropic diffusion in lab
frame and effect of different parameter on transition time. Our work is useful for understanding 
transport and motion of anisotropic macromolecules in membranes and also for random walk
modeling micro swimmers such as E.coli that it is similar to ellipsoidal particles.

# Introduction

Brownian motion is the random motion of microscopic particles suspended in liquids or gases. This motion results from the impact of molecules of the surrounding medium. Einstein was the first who treated this subject theoretically. The theory of Brownian motion of ellipsoids was first developed
by Francis Perrin.
Particles have two kind of Brownian motion: Translational and Rotational motion.
Because of difficulties in visualization of rotation Brownian motion, there are less works on fundamental
concepts in this subject.
In this research, we modeled the Brownian motion of an ellipsoidal particle and calculated its translational and rotational diffusion. Transition time between short-time anisotropic to long-time isotropic also observed.

# Theory

An ellipsoid is characterized by two translational and rotational hydrodynamic friction coefficients f1
and f2 along major and minor axis respectively. Diffusion coefficient Di=kBT/fi that i is along major (a)
and minor (b) axis of an ellipsoid where kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the temperature.

Rotational diffusion characterized in two dimensions by a single diffusion coefficient, Dθ and associated
diffusion time θ= 1/2Dθ washed out directional memory and leads to a crossover from anisotropic
diffusion at short time to isotropic diffusion at times much longer than θ.
