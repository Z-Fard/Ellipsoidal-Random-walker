Brownian Motion of Anisotropic Particles In Two Dimensions

We modeled the Brownian motion of an ellipsoidal particle in two dimensions. We simulated
its behavior by using square lattice for position (x,y) and concidering orientation of particle.
We are looking for crossover from short-time anisotropic to the long-time isotropic diffusion in lab
frame and effect of different parameter on transition time. Our work is useful for understanding 
transport and motion of anisotropic macromolecules in membranes and also for random walk
modeling micro swimmers such as E.coli that it is similar to ellipsoidal particles.
